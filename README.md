## Muse is

**None of these things yet.**

- Gradually Typed.
  - Strong runtime typing.
  - Dynamic typing by default
  - In the future, ability to annotate types and have compile time checking and
    potentially more optimizations.
- Virtual Machine-powered
  - Each VM has its own Stack and isolated environment.
  - VMs can be metered to safely execute untrusted code.
  - As long as all Rust helpers have proper error handling, a virtual machine
    should never panic.
